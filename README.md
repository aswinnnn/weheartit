## **weheartit**
**A fast, reliable API wrapper for weheartit.com**

# Description
weheartit (named after the site itself, [weheartit](https://weheartit.com))
is a fast, **usable** API wrapper for weheartit.com

[We Heart It](https://weheartit.com) does not have an API. So i make use of `BeautifulSoup`
and `requests` to do my job. The speed is optimal, but if you want
as asynchronous or faster module, just let me know.

# requirements
there are only two requirements for this module:
* `beautifulsoup4`
* `requests`

you can easily install these packages using [pip](https://pypi.org)
