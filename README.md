## **weheartit**
**A fast, reliable API wrapper for weheartit.com**

# Description
weheartit (named after the site itself, [weheartit](https://weheartit.com)),
is a fast, **usable** API wrapper for weheartit.com

* weheartit does not have an API. So i make use of `BeautifulSoup`
and `requests` to do my job. The speed is optimal, but if you want
as asynchronous or faster module,just let me know.
